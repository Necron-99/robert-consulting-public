# Terraform Duplicate Resource Fix

## Issue
Terraform was showing duplicate resource errors because both the original and fixed CloudWatch dashboard files existed in the same directory:

```
Error: Duplicate resource "aws_cloudwatch_dashboard" configuration
A aws_cloudwatch_dashboard resource named "cost_monitoring" was already declared
```

## Root Cause
Both files existed simultaneously:
- `cloudwatch-dashboards.tf` (original with dot notation issues)
- `cloudwatch-dashboards-fixed.tf` (fixed version)

This caused Terraform to see duplicate resource definitions.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ **Removed Duplicate Files**
1. **Deleted original file**: `cloudwatch-dashboards.tf`
2. **Renamed fixed file**: `cloudwatch-dashboards-fixed.tf` → `cloudwatch-dashboards.tf`
3. **Verified single configuration**: Only one CloudWatch dashboard file now exists

### 📁 **File Structure After Fix**
```
terraform/
├── cloudwatch-dashboards.tf     # Fixed version (renamed from -fixed.tf)
├── testing-site.tf              # Testing site configuration
├── bootstrap.tf                  # Bootstrap configuration
└── backend.tf                   # Backend configuration
```

### 🔧 **Configuration Status**
- ✅ **No duplicate resources** - Single CloudWatch dashboard configuration
- ✅ **Fixed dot notation** - All metrics use full names
- ✅ **Simplified widgets** - Single metric per widget
- ✅ **Proper validation** - CloudWatch API compliant

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Terraform Configuration
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 2. Verify Dashboards
- Check CloudWatch console for dashboards
- Verify all metrics are displaying
- Test alert configurations

### 3. Monitor Resources
- Cost monitoring dashboard
- Service status dashboard  
- Performance dashboard
- CloudWatch alarms

## Dashboard URLs
After successful deployment:

- **Cost Monitoring**: `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=robert-consulting-cost-monitoring`
- **Service Status**: `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=robert-consulting-service-status`
- **Performance**: `https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=robert-consulting-performance`

## Benefits

### ✅ **Resolved Issues**
- No more duplicate resource errors
