# Dashboard Data Validation Test Plan

## Test Objectives
- Verify all dashboard data is dynamic and not static/placeholder values
- Ensure service health shows "HEALTHY" instead of "UNKNOWN"
- Validate performance metrics are reasonable and changing
- Confirm cost data remains stable and accurate
- Test dashboard UI displays all data correctly

## Test Cases

### 1. API Endpoint Validation
- [ ] API responds with 200 status
- [ ] Response contains all required sections (aws, traffic, health, serviceHealth, performance, github, velocity)
- [ ] All data types are correct (numbers, strings, objects)
- [ ] No null or undefined values in critical fields

### 2. Service Health Validation
- [ ] All services show "healthy" status
- [ ] No "UNKNOWN" statuses
- [ ] Last updated timestamp is current
- [ ] Service metrics are populated (requests, errors, etc.)

### 3. Performance Metrics Validation
- [ ] Response time varies between calls (not static 322ms)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals values are reasonable
- [ ] Page speed scores are realistic
- [ ] Resource timing values are dynamic

### 4. GitHub Statistics Validation
- [ ] Commit counts are dynamic and realistic
- [ ] Development activity metrics are populated
- [ ] Repository statistics are reasonable
- [ ] Activity metrics (stars, forks) are present

### 5. Cost Data Validation
- [ ] Monthly cost total is $16.50 (stable)
- [ ] Individual service costs match expected values
- [ ] No radical changes in cost structure
- [ ] Cost trend is reasonable

### 6. Dashboard UI Validation
- [ ] All sections load without errors
- [ ] Data displays correctly in UI elements
- [ ] Timestamps show current time
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Refresh functionality works

## Test Execution Steps

1. **API Testing**: Test API endpoint directly
2. **Dashboard Testing**: Load dashboard page and verify UI
3. **Refresh Testing**: Test auto-refresh and manual refresh
4. **Error Handling**: Test fallback scenarios
5. **Performance Testing**: Verify metrics change over time

## Success Criteria
- All services show "HEALTHY" status
- Response time varies between API calls
- No static/placeholder values visible
- Cost data remains stable
- Dashboard loads without errors
- All timestamps are current
