## üìã Cleanup Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Verification (No Actions)
1. Verify each resource's current usage
2. Confirm which resources are duplicates
3. Document dependencies

### Phase 2: High Priority Cleanup
1. Delete confirmed orphaned S3 buckets
2. Delete duplicate Lambda functions
3. Delete duplicate DynamoDB tables

### Phase 3: Medium Priority Cleanup
1. Delete duplicate WAF resources
2. Delete duplicate IAM roles
3. Delete duplicate secrets

### Phase 4: Low Priority Cleanup
1. Delete duplicate API Gateway endpoints
2. Delete duplicate CloudFront functions
3. Delete duplicate ACM certificates
4. Delete unused CloudWatch log groups
5. Delete unused SES configuration sets

## üí∞ Total Estimated Monthly Savings
- **High Priority**: $8-23/month
- **Medium Priority**: $5-10/month
- **Low Priority**: $1-2/month
- **Total**: $14-35/month

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Measures
1. **Backup Verification**: All current resources are backed up in Terraform state
2. **Dependency Checking**: Each resource will be verified for dependencies before deletion
3. **Rollback Plan**: Terraform can recreate any accidentally deleted resources
4. **Approval Required**: Each phase requires explicit approval before execution

## üéØ Next Steps
1. **Review this plan** and approve the approach
2. **Approve Phase 1** (verification only, no deletions)
3. **Review verification results** and approve specific deletions
4. **Execute approved cleanup** in phases

**Status**: Awaiting approval to begin Phase 1 (verification)
