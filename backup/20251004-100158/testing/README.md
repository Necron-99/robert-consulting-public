## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Costs
```bash
# Check resource usage
./cost-monitor.sh

# Clean up unnecessary files
aws s3 rm s3://your-bucket --recursive

# Review CloudFront usage
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID
```

#### Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify bucket permissions
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket

# Check CloudFront status
aws cloudfront get-distribution --id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check S3 bucket size
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket --recursive --human-readable --summarize

# Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```
