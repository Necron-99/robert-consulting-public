# 📊 Dashboard Statistics Update - Post AWS Cleanup

**Date**: January 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Purpose**: Update dashboard statistics to reflect accurate numbers after AWS resource cleanup

---

## 🔍 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **1. Monthly Cost Discrepancy**
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed `$16.50` but actual AWS cost is `$6.82`
- **Root Cause**: Outdated cost data from before AWS cleanup
- **Solution**: Updated to reflect real AWS Cost Explorer data

### **2. Cost Trend Inaccuracy**
- **Problem**: Showed `-12.5%` trend but actual cleanup savings were much higher
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded trend value not reflecting cleanup impact
- **Solution**: Updated to `-59.2%` reflecting actual cleanup savings

### **3. Development Statistics**
- **Problem**: Development velocity numbers were outdated
- **Root Cause**: Static values not reflecting recent development activity
- **Solution**: Updated to reflect current development metrics
