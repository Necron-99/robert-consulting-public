## ⚠️ WAF Deletion Issues

### Problem Analysis
The WAF Web ACLs could not be deleted due to complex dependencies. Possible reasons:

1. **IP Set Dependencies**: WAF Web ACLs may reference IP sets that need to be deleted first
2. **CloudFront Associations**: Web ACLs might be associated with CloudFront distributions
3. **Rule Dependencies**: Complex rule configurations preventing deletion
4. **AWS Service Dependencies**: Other AWS services might be referencing these Web ACLs

### Investigation Results
- ✅ **CloudFront Associations**: Confirmed no active CloudFront distributions use these Web ACLs
- ✅ **IP Sets**: Only `staging-allowed-ips` exists and is actively used
- ❌ **Rule Dependencies**: Complex rule configurations preventing deletion
- ❌ **Service Dependencies**: Unknown dependencies blocking deletion

### Recommended Actions
1. **Manual Investigation**: Requires AWS Console access to identify dependencies
2. **AWS Support**: May need AWS support to identify blocking dependencies
3. **Alternative Approach**: Leave WAF resources for now and focus on other cleanup
4. **Cost Impact**: Minimal - WAF Web ACLs have low ongoing costs
